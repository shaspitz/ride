# ride
**ride** is a blockchain for ride sharing built utilizing the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).

## TLDR
Focuses on the business logic for such an idea, with the assumption that a [proof-of-location](https://tokens-economy.gitbook.io/consensus/chain-based-proof-of-capacity-space/dynamic-proof-of-location) like system would be implemented elsewhere. 

## Common CLI Commands

## Get started

```
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

### Web Frontend

Ignite CLI has scaffolded a Vue.js-based web app in the `vue` directory. Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the app:

```
cd vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

The frontend app is built using the `@starport/vue` and `@starport/vuex` packages. For details, see the [monorepo for Ignite front-end development](https://github.com/ignite-hq/web).

## Release
To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

### Install
To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/smarshall-spitzbart/ride@latest! | sudo bash
```
`smarshall-spitzbart/ride` should match the `username` and `repo_name` of the Github repository to which the source code was pushed. Learn more about [the install process](https://github.com/allinbits/starport-installer).
